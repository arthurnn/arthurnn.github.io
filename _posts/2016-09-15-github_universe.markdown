This is one of the best tweets I've seen in a while:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear GitHub,<br>Thank you</p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/776178826028126209">September 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

After GitHub Universe Keynote, (we announced)[https://github.com/universe-2016] a bunch of new great features that are enabled right now at GitHub.com, and I am glad folks out there are happy about them.
My favorite feature is the new pull request review workflow. 
Hope you all enjoy the new features. And if you have any feedback, fell free to send it to me, or to the GitHub help team.
Also, I have a (repository)[https://github.com/arthurnn/meta/issues] where I track features requests people want for GitHub.
